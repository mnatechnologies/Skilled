  // FAQs
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How much does demolition cost?",
      answer:
        "Costs vary depending on the size and type of structure, accessibility, asbestos presence, and disposal requirements. We provide free, no-obligation quotes after a site assessment. Residential demolitions in Sydney typically range from $15,000 to $80,000+.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need council approval for demolition?",
      answer:
        "Yes, most demolition work in NSW requires a Development Application (DA) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC). We handle all the paperwork and approvals as part of our service, so you don't need to worry about the process.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical demolition take?",
      answer:
        "A standard residential demolition usually takes 1-3 days once we're on site. Larger commercial projects may take 1-2 weeks. Timeframes depend on size, complexity, and whether asbestos is present. We'll give you a clear timeline during the quoting process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle asbestos removal?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we are fully licensed for asbestos identification and removal in NSW. If asbestos is found during assessment, we follow all SafeWork NSW regulations for safe removal and disposal. This is included as part of our complete demolition service.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to the demolition waste?",
      answer:
        "We're committed to sustainability. Up to 90% of demolition materials are recycled or repurposed — including concrete, timber, metal, and bricks. All waste is sorted on-site and disposed of at licensed facilities in compliance with EPA regulations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are you fully insured?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We carry comprehensive public liability insurance and workers' compensation for all our team members. We're also fully licensed by NSW Fair Trading. Copies of our insurance certificates are available upon request.",
